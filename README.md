# Programming in C and C++

This is a book on C and C++. The book tries to provide many examples (over 200, yes too many) to learn practical real world C and C++.

See usecases sections in both C and C++ and the example / writing your own library functions as a starting
point to experience complex programming technique and very rare and tough problems in software engineering (such as asynchronous programming,
frameworks, message passing between threads, memory management) and real world coding practises.

Usecases also cover frameworks such as,

1. Data structures in C (LinkedLists, Circular Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash tables, Ring buffers)
2. Thread pools.
3. Searching (Bubble, Insertion, Quick, Merge..)  and Sort (Linear, Binary) algorithms written in C++.
4. Design patterns (Singleton, Builder, Factory, Facade, Adaptor).
5. Caches (LRU).
